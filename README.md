# ARS-DAG-TraitResearch
File and scripts for the analysis and creation of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

This repository provides the scripts required for the preprocessing of data, combination of data, and construction of causal probability models. Please refer to the steps below for the replication of the study.

[Folder 1 - BLUPs]
- This folder contains the scripts for the BLUP calculations for each study, respectively. To run, download the trait file and run it with the associated calculator (be sure to have the two in the same directory, or a path specifing the file location). Each script contains lines that will produce correlation plots and matricies (and hypothessis matricies). Additionally, for some of the scripts the inclusion of boxplots and check distributions are availble; however, need to be uncommented to execute.
